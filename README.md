## ASCII Torus

This project was inspired by the idea of contemporary art and the question: what is contemporary art? Can it be a digital donut? Here, a simple ASCII torus spins in your terminal or browser, exploring the boundary between code, art, and visual experience.

### Variants
- **Terminal (Python)**: Run in a console using `python terminal/main.py`.
- **Browser (HTML/JS)**: Open [browser version](https://dbrgmnn.github.io/tor/).
